    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
    <p>Thankyou for your recent application to join us at the
        University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your <abbr
            title="doctorate of philosophy">phD</abbr> next year.I will answer your questions one
        by
        one, in the following sections.</p>
    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <p>we are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at at any
        time,however it would suit us better if you would start at beginning of a semester;the start dates for each one
        are
        as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please let me
        know if this is ok,and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
    <p>You can find more information about <a href="">important
            university dates</a> on our website</p>
    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty,we have a pretty open-minded
        research facility-as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology.You seem like an
        intelligent,dedicated researcher,
        and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were
        most
        intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine and the health benefits of
            Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk
            bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&#x2103;(86&#x2109;),when the audience size exponentially increases
            (effect of
            3x10<sup>3</sup>
            increasing to 3x10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
        <li><abbr title="hypertext markup language">html</abbr> and <abbr title="cascading style sheet">css</abbr>
            constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So can you please provide more
        information on each of these subjects including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff
        and
        other resources,and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks</p>
    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
    <p>Yes you are right! As part of
        my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as
        follows,
        with defintions:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
        <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC , a
            whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens,to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful"
        </dd>
        <dt>Icelandic
            brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>Before the icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance,
            which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in
            imperceptibly
            tiny,very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern
            styles
            such as Twerking</dd>
        <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
        <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation,English explorers in the
            1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic",stilted movements,being
            practiced
            by
            inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada,Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like
            this
            because they were really cold.</dd>
