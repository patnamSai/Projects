            <h1>Article on introverts</h1>
            <h3><em>They make themselves laugh</em></h2>
                They prefer their own company at times which at most times involve spending an insane amount of time
                toying
                around with their thoughts and ideas. They do love daydreaming, creating, reading, watching a movie,
                relaxing, and they genuinely make themselves laugh at times.
                <h3><em>They need to be alone to recharge</em></h3>
                Introverts need to be alone to recharge. People tend to think
                that introverts are shy, socially awkward individuals or plain boring. Well, this is quite contrary
                to
                what
                they are.ntroverts value genuine relationships and will have deep conversations at length. They are
                not
                shy
                but will avoid meaningless talks at all cost. They prefer a small but closer group of friends and
                will
                need
                some “alone time” to recharge after putting on a front for others.
                <h3><em>They like people and they don’t</em></h3>
                Introverts make the best friends because they get to know others better. They enjoy others’ presence
                when
                they are comfortable enough to sit with them in silence. They like getting to know the real side of
                others
                and will definitely stay away from people faking their personalities.

                Introverts despise gossip or meaningless talk and will avoid such people at all cost This
                double-edged
                sword
                creates a world of always wondering which category people fall in.
                <h3><em>They wished others loved them as deeply as they do</em></h3>
                Since introverts spend a bulk of their free time thinking, they also tend to love deeply due to
                their
                interest in the other person. Most often, an introvert loves their partner more than their partner
                loves
                them. They think about their partner many times throughout the day, they want to know them better
                and
                think
                of ways to make them happier
                <h3><em>They don’t like unexpected visitors</em></h3>
                They don’t like and anticipate unexpected visitors. It’s not rude or anything, just that They have
                their
                time mapped out.

                Introverts always have their days planned out and random distractions could come out as very
                annoying.
                They
                have put a lot of thought into how they want their day to go. If you unexpectedly visit, you throw
                it
                all
                off.
                <h3><em>Attention-seeking behaviours annoy them</em></h3>
                Introverts get easily annoyed by people who act fake in order to get attention. They don’t
                understand
                why
                someone would crave to be the center of others’ attention.
                <h3><em>They won’t answer the phone if they don’t know who’s calling them</em></h3>
                They also won’t answer the phone if they know who it is at times. It’s nothing personal, but there
                could
                be
                a host of reasons they might not receive that call. They could be going through something and need
                to
                think
                about it. They might be in the middle of a project, or they’re just not in the mood to have a
                lengthy
                conversation. Also, They’d rather text something that will take a couple of minutes rather than talk
                on
                the
                phone about the same thing.

                If they do take your call, take it as a huge compliment.
                <h3><em>They easily get distracted</em></h3>
                Introverts enjoy working in quiet environments, away from others or excess stimuli. They get
                distracted
                by
                certain noises that might totally be avoided by others if in the same room.

                water dripping from a faucet, non-rhythmic clatter and a variety of sounds can be pretty annoying to
                an
                introvert. Soothing sounds don’t bother them. Movement in their range of sight can serve as
                distractions
                too.

            <h1>(Differentiation)extroversion and introversion</h1>
            <p><strong>Extraversion</strong>
                Extraversion (also spelled as extroversion) is the state of primarily obtaining gratification from
                outside oneself.Extraverts tend to enjoy human interactions and to be enthusiastic, talkative,
                assertive, and gregarious. Extraverts are energized and thrive off being around other people. They
                take
                pleasure in activities that involve large social gatherings, such as parties, community activities,
                public demonstrations, and business or political groups. They also tend to work well in groups.An
                extraverted person is likely to enjoy time spent with people and find less reward in time spent
                alone.
                They tend to be energized when around other people, and they are more prone to boredom when they are
                by
                themselves.</p>
            <p><strong>Introversion</strong>
                Introversion is the state of being predominantly interested in one's own mental self.Introverts are
                typically perceived as more reserved or reflective.Some popular psychologists have characterized
                introverts as people whose energy tends to expand through reflection and dwindle during interaction.
                This is similar to Jung's view, although he focused on mental energy rather than physical energy.
                Few
                modern conceptions make this distinction. Introverts often take pleasure in solitary activities such
                as
                reading, writing, or meditating. An introvert is likely to enjoy time spent alone and find less
                reward
                in time spent with large groups of people. Introverts are easily overwhelmed by too much stimulation
                from social gatherings and engagement, introversion having even been defined by some in terms of a
                preference for a quiet, more minimally stimulating external environment.They prefer to concentrate
                on a single activity at a time and like to observe situations before they participate, especially
                observed in developing children and adolescents.They are more analytical before speaking.</p>

        <p class="special">constellation, in astronomy, any of certain groupings of stars that were imagined—at
            least by those who
            named them—to form conspicuous configurations of objects or creatures in the sky. Constellations are
            useful in assisting astronomers and navigators to locate certain stars.</p>
        <p class="cleared">From the earliest times the star groups known as constellations, the smaller groups
            (parts of
            constellations) known as asterisms, and also individual stars have received names connoting some
            meteorological phenomena or symbolizing religious or mythological beliefs. At one time it was held that
            the constellation names and myths were of Greek origin; this view has now been disproved, and an
            examination of the Hellenic myths associated with the stars and star groups in the light of the records
            revealed by the deciphering of Mesopotamian cuneiforms leads to the conclusion that in many, if not all,
            cases the Greek myth has a Mesopotamian parallel.</p>

    <h1>Bermuda triangle</h1>
    <div class="column">
        <div class="fragment">
            <p>The Bermuda Triangle is a region of the North Atlantic Ocean (roughly) bounded by the southeastern coast
                of the
                U.S., Bermuda, and the islands of the Greater Antilles (Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico).
                The exact boundaries of the Bermuda Triangle are not universally agreed upon. Approximations of the
                total area
                range between 500,000 and 1,510,000 square miles (1,300,000 and 3,900,000 square kilometers). By all
                approximations, the region has a vaguely triangular shape.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fragment">
            <p>The Bermuda Triangle does not appear on any world maps, and the U.S. Board on Geographic Names does not
                recognize the Bermuda Triangle as an official region of the Atlantic Ocean.
                Although reports of unexplained occurrences in the region date to the mid-19th century, the phrase
                “Bermuda
                Triangle” didn’t come into use until 1964. The phrase first appeared in print in a pulp magazine article
                by
                Vincent Gaddis, who used the phrase to describe a triangular region “that has destroyed hundreds of
                ships and
                planes without a trace.”</p>

            <p>Despite its reputation, the Bermuda Triangle does not have a high incidence of disappearances.
                Disappearances do
                not occur with greater frequency in the Bermuda Triangle than in any other comparable region of the
                Atlantic
                Ocean.</p>
        </div>

            <p>At least two incidents in the region involved U.S. military craft. In March 1918 the collier USS Cyclops,
                en
                route to Baltimore, Maryland, from Brazil, disappeared inside the Bermuda Triangle. No explanation was
                given for
                its disappearance, and no wreckage was found. Some 27 years later, a squadron of bombers (collectively
                known as
                Flight 19) under American Lieut. Charles Carroll Taylor disappeared in the airspace above the Bermuda
                Triangle.
                As in the Cyclops incident, no explanation was given and no wreckage was found.</p>

        <div class="fragment">
            <p>Charles Berlitz popularized the legend of the Bermuda Triangle in his best-selling book The Bermuda
                Triangle
                (1974). In the book, Berlitz claimed that the fabled lost island of Atlantis was involved in the
                disappearances.
                In 2013 the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) conducted an exhaustive study of maritime shipping lanes and
                determined
                that the Bermuda Triangle is not one of the world’s 10 most dangerous bodies of water for shipping.
                The Bermuda Triangle sustains heavy daily traffic, both by sea and by air.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fragment">
            <p>The Bermuda Triangle is one of the most heavily traveled shipping lanes in the world.
                The agonic line sometimes passes through the Bermuda Triangle, including a period in the early 20th
                century. The
                agonic line is a place on Earth’s surface where true north and magnetic north align, and there is no
                need to
                account for magnetic declination on a compass.
                The Bermuda Triangle is subject to frequent tropical storms and hurricanes.
                The Gulf Stream—a strong ocean current known to cause sharp changes in local weather—passes through the
                Bermuda
                Triangle.</p>

            <p>The deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean, the Milwaukee Depth, is located in the Bermuda Triangle. The
                Puerto
                Rico Trench reaches a depth of 27,493 feet (8,380 meters) at the Milwaukee Depth.
                What is not known about the Bermuda Triangle:
                The exact number of ships and airplanes that have disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle is not known. The
                most
                common estimate is about 50 ships and 20 airplanes.
                The wreckage of many ships and airplanes reported missing in the region has not been recovered.
                It is not known whether disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle have been the result of human error or
                weather
                phenomena.</p>

                One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers sat over their winter fire in the
                little French town of Annonay, watching the grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide chimney.
                Their names were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were papermakers by trade, and were noted as
                possessing thoughtful minds and a deep interest in all scientific knowledge and new discovery.</p>
            <p>Before that night—a memorable night, as it was to prove—hundreds of millions of people had watched the
                rising smoke-wreaths of their fires without drawing any special inspiration from the fact.”</p>
