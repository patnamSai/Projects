            Cryptography is the study of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and intended
            recipient of a message to view its contents. The term is derived from the Greek word kryptos, which means
            hidden. It is closely associated to encryption, which is the act of scrambling ordinary text into what's
            known as ciphertext and then back again upon arrival. In addition, cryptography also covers the obfuscation
            of information in images using techniques such as microdots or merging. Ancient Egyptians were known to use
            these methods in complex hieroglyphics, and Roman Emperor Julius Caesar is credited with using one of the
            first modern ciphers.

            When transmitting electronic data, the most common use of cryptography is to encrypt and decrypt email and
            other plain-text messages. The simplest method uses the symmetric or "secret key" system. Here, data is
            encrypted using a secret key, and then both the encoded message and secret key are sent to the recipient for
            decryption. The problem? If the message is intercepted, a third party has everything they need to decrypt
            and read the message. To address this issue, cryptologists devised the asymmetric or "public key" system. In
            this case, every user has two keys: one public and one private. Senders request the public key of their
            intended recipient, encrypt the message and send it along. When the message arrives, only the recipient's
            private key will decode it â€” meaning theft is of no use without the corresponding private key.
