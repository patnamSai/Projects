    <p>When someone asks you to describe an introvert, your thoughts might go to the most reserved and thoughtful
        person you know. Maybe you think of the friend who mostly avoids special attention and social engagements,
        or the sibling who prefers to occupy a quiet corner with a book or the family dog.</p>

    <p>But what if you’re the one who prefers a quiet night at home to a crowded party? Maybe you feel exhausted
        and drained after interacting with anyone other than a close friend or two. If so, you might have started to
        wonder whether you’re an introvert yourself.</p>

    <p>Introversion itself isn’t a measurable personality trait, as such. Rather, introversion refers to low levels
        of extroversion (originally referred to as extraversion; a person with extraversion traits was referred to
        as an extravert).</p><br>

        <h2><em>Personality traits of an introvert</em></h2>
        <p>A number of factors help shape the unique characteristics that make you who you are, and these factors can
            also affect the ways introversion shows up in your personality. To put it another way, no two introverts are
            exactly alike.</p>

        <p>That said, you might recognize introversion in yourself by some of the following traits and behaviors.</p>

        <h3>You need plenty of time for yourself</h3>
        <p>Do you consider periods of solitude essential for optimal health and well-being? Maybe you find the thought
            of a quiet night at home positively delightful, whether you plan to spend that time simply resting or
            enjoying a quiet hobby on your own.</p>

        <p>If time alone prompts feelings of peace and relief, not disappointment and stress, you’re likely more
            introverted than extroverted.</p>

        <h3>Too much socializing drains you</h3>
        <p>It’s not true that introverts hate social interaction and avoid it entirely. All the same, you might find
            yourself needing more time to recharge between events than a more extroverted person.</p>

        <p>Hanging out with friends on Friday might max out your energy, leaving you craving solitude on Saturday to
            rest and refuel.</p>

        <h3>You have a hard time with conflict</h3>
        <p>Everyday interactions can be draining enough on their own, but what about situations that involve the
            possibility of conflict?</p>

        <p>Some evidence suggests introverted people tend to have a greater sensitivity to negative evaluation and
            criticism. You might find it tough to share your thoughts when you believe others might disagree with you or
            disapprove of your opinion. As a result, you might find yourself avoiding conflict whenever possible.</p>

        <h3>You work better on your own</h3>
        <p>The mere words “group project” might spark fear in anyone’s heart, but if you find working in groups
            particularly loathsome, you could certainly be more of an introvert.</p>

        <p>Working at your own pace gives you time to reflect and consider your approach before focusing your energy on
            the task, without having to navigate group dynamics or tune out the chatter.</p>

        <p>Of course, this doesn’t necessarily mean you have trouble getting along with others. You may just find it
            easier to concentrate when working alone. That goes for your hobbies, too — introverted people often choose
            solitary pastimes, like reading, crafting, gaming, or gardening.</p>

        <h3>The spotlight doesn’t tempt you</h3>
        <p>Maybe you don’t mind working in smaller groups, but you always choose behind-the-scenes roles.</p>

        <p>That might mean you’d rather do the research and write up the report than present it, or you volunteer for
            tasks that keep you away from the crowd. Far from being the center of attention, you’d rather hover on the
            fringes where you escape notice.</p>

        <h3>You prefer a close circle of friends</h3>
        <p>Many introverts have just a small circle of friends, but it’s not because they can’t make friends or dislike
            people. ResearchTrusted Source suggests, in fact, that high-quality relationships play a major role in
            happiness for introverts.</p>

        <p>If you’re an introvert, you might simply prefer to have a few close, intimate friendships rather than a
            large circle of casual acquaintances. After all, you need more time to yourself than an extroverted person
            might, so you probably have less time to spend connecting and catching up with a crowd.</p>

        <h3>You get to know people on a deeper level</h3>
        <p>If you tend to keep to yourself, you might find it perfectly natural to listen and observe from the
            sidelines. Watching what goes on around you can give you more insight into others and offer clues to their
            personality and preferences.</p>

        <p>Expressing yourself not your strong point? You might become a good listener instead, perhaps even develop a
            knack for picking up on body language and less obvious cues and emotions in someone’s words, behavior, or
            tone of voice.</p>

        <p>The end result? You learn more about others, which can boost empathy and your ability to offer emotional
            support.</p>

        <p>You spend a lot of time absorbed in your own thoughts
            Maybe you:</p>

        <p>find yourself daydreaming or running through scenarios in your mind before you settle on a plan of action
            need more time to process information and weigh options carefully when making decisions
            do extensive research before making a big purchase or accepting a job offer
            brainstorm a plan of action ahead of major events to prepare for every possibility
            Introverts often have an active inner thought process, so these traits can all suggest introversion.</p>

        <h3>You zone out to get away</h3>
        <p>Do you catch yourself “escaping” from unpleasant or stressful situations by letting your mind wander or
            drift to something more relaxing?</p>

        <p>Anyone can zone out, but turning inward may offer introverts a way to leave situations that feel chaotic or
            uncomfortable. In short, it can serve as a survival mechanism, of sorts.</p>

        <p>This tendency to get lost in your thoughts may leave others with the impression that you’re shy, distracted,
            or disinterested. In reality, though, it can help you cope in tense or overwhelming environments, from a
            loud holiday party to a long meeting with several short-tempered colleagues.</p>

        <h3>You prefer writing over talking</h3>
        <p>Maybe the thought of small talk makes you shudder, but writing out your thoughts comes naturally, especially
            when you’re dealing with complex or difficult emotions.</p>

        <p>Many introverts take time to think carefully before speaking, so you might have a hard time offering a quick
            opinion about anything. Writing, on the other hand, allows you to consider your position thoroughly and
            choose just the right words to express yourself with confidence and care.</p>
