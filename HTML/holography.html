    <h1>How it works</h1>

    <p>Holography is a technique that enables a <strong class="special">light field</strong>(which is generally the result of a light source scattered
        off
        objects) to be recorded and later reconstructed when the original light field is no longer present, due to the
        absence of the original objects.[15]:

    <h2>Section 1</h2>Holography can be thought of as somewhat similar to sound
    recording, whereby a sound field created by vibrating matter like musical instruments or vocal cords, is encoded in
    such a way that it can be reproduced later, without the presence of the original vibrating matter.[16] However, it
    is even more similar to Ambisonic sound recording in which any listening angle of a sound field can be reproduced in
    the reproduction.</p>

    <h1>Laser</h1>
    <p>In laser holography, the hologram is recorded using a source of laser light, which is very pure in its color and
        orderly in its composition. Various setups may be used, and several types of holograms can be made, but all
        involve
        the interaction of light coming from different directions and producing a microscopic interference pattern which
        a
        plate, film, or other medium photographically records.</p>

    <p>In one common arrangement, the laser beam is split into two, one known as the object beam and the other as the
        reference beam. The object beam is expanded by passing it through a lens and used to illuminate the subject. The
        recording medium is located where this light, after being reflected or scattered by the subject, will strike it.
        The
        edges of the medium will ultimately serve as a window through which the subject is seen, so its location is
        chosen
        with that in mind. The reference beam is expanded and made to shine directly on the medium, where it interacts
        with
        the light coming from the subject to create the desired interference pattern.</p>

    <p>Like conventional photography, holography requires an appropriate exposure time to correctly affect the recording
        medium. Unlike conventional photography, during the exposure the light source, the optical elements, the
        recording
        medium, and the subject must all remain motionless relative to each other, to within about a quarter of the
        wavelength of the light, or the interference pattern will be blurred and the hologram spoiled. With living
        subjects
        and some unstable materials, that is only possible if a very intense and extremely brief pulse of laser light is
        used, a <em>hazardous</em> procedure which is rare and rarely done outside of scientific and industrial laboratory
        settings.
        Exposures lasting several seconds to several minutes, using a much lower-powered continuously operating laser,
        are
        typical.</p>


    <h1>Apparatus</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>A hologram can be made by shining part of the light beam directly into the recording medium, and the
                other part onto
                the object in such a way that some of the scattered light falls onto the recording medium.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> A more flexible
                arrangement for recording a hologram requires the laser beam to be aimed through a series of elements
                that change it
                in different ways. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The first element is a <em>beam splitter</em> that divides the beam into two identical beams, each aimed
                in different directions:</p>
        </li>


        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>One beam (known as the 'illumination' or 'object beam') is spread using lenses and directed onto the
                    scene using
                    mirrors.</p>
            </li>

            Some of the light scattered (reflected) from the scene then falls onto the recording medium.



            <li>
                <p>The second beam (known as the 'reference beam') is also spread through the use of lenses, but is
                    directed
                    so that it
                    does not come in contact with the scene, and instead travels directly onto the recording medium.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <li>
            <p>Several different materials can be used as the recording medium.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> One of the most common is a film very similar to
                photographic film (silver halide photographic emulsion), but with a much higher concentration of
                light-reactive
                grains, making it capable of the much higher resolution that holograms require.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> A layer of this recording medium
                (e.g., silver halide) is attached to a transparent substrate, which is commonly glass, but may also
                be
                plastic.</p>
        </li>

    </ol>
    <h1>Process</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>When the two laser beams reach the recording medium, their light waves intersect and interfere with each
                other.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>It
                is this interference pattern that is imprinted on the recording medium. </p>
        </li>
        <p>The pattern itself is seemingly random,
            as
            it represents the way in which the scene's light interfered with the original light source – but not the
            original
            light source itself.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> The interference pattern can be considered an encoded version of the scene, requiring a
                particular key – the original light source – in order to view its contents.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>This missing key is provided later by shining a laser, identical to the one used to record the hologram,
                onto the
                developed film. When this beam illuminates the hologram, it is diffracted by the hologram's surface
                pattern.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> This
                produces a light field identical to the one originally produced by the scene and scattered onto the
                hologram.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Holographic interferometry</h1>










    <h2>Main article: holographic interferometry</h2>
    <p>Holographic interferometry (HI) is a technique that enables static and dynamic displacements of objects with
        optically rough surfaces to be measured to optical interferometric precision (i.e. to fractions of a wavelength
        of
        light).[32][33] It can also be used to detect optical-path-length variations in transparent media, which
        enables,
        for example, fluid flow to be visualized and analyzed. It can also be used to generate contours representing the
        form of the surface or the isodose regions in radiation dosimetry.[34]</p>

    It has been widely used to measure stress, strain, and vibration in engineering structures.

    <h1 class="note">Interferometric microscopy</h1>
    <h2>Main article: Interferometric microscopy</h2>
    <p>The hologram keeps the information on the amplitude and phase of the field. Several holograms may keep
        information
        about the same distribution of light, emitted to various directions. The numerical analysis of such holograms
        allows
        one to emulate large numerical aperture, which, in turn, enables enhancement of the resolution of optical
        microscopy. The corresponding technique is called interferometric microscopy. Recent achievements of
        interferometric
        microscopy allow one to approach the quarter-wavelength limit of resolution.[35]</p>

    <h1>Sensors or biosensors</h1>
    <h2>Main article: Holographic sensor</h2>
    <p>The hologram is made with a modified material that interacts with certain molecules generating a change in the
        fringe periodicity or refractive index, therefore, the color of the holographic reflection.[36][37]</p>
